### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Victor Maragioglio
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer
Based in Berlin, Germany.

I go with âœ¨ MERN STACK âœ¨ since was the one I learned (and still learning) but also willing to learn other types of languages and frameworks.
I like to work  in a project when the first stage of the product is develop using Agile Methodologies and Figma to prototype the app; that give developers a clear background of the scope and expectations of designers and investors.

When working in a team I use Git and Slack or any tool that facilitate comunication channels.
