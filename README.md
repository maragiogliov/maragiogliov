### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Victor Maragioglio
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer
Based in Berlin, Germany.

>>>>>>> 

I go with âœ¨ MERN STACK âœ¨ since was the one we learned (and still learning) but also willing to learn other types of languages and frameworks.
I like to develop the first stage of the product using Agile Methodologies and after discovering the Key Players, HMW, and first frames of the application (and hundred other stuff), then I use Figma to prototype the UX/UI... prior to that, coding might be a mistake.

When working in a team I use Git and Slack.
