I normally go with MERN STACK ARCHITECTURE since was the one we learned (and still learning) but also willing to learn other types of languages and frameworks.

I like to develop the first stage of the product using Agile Methodologies and after discovering the Key Players, HMW, and first frames of the application (and hundred other stuff), then I use Figma to prototype the UX/UI... prior to that, coding might be a mistake.

When working in a team I use Git and Slack or whatever it takes.
